# Mini-ELF Interpreter
*********************
In this project, Y86 instructions are retrievedd from a virtual memory image and decoded
to produce the assembly language code. The execution is then simulated through an
interpreter for the Y86 architecure.

It follows the Von Neumann architecure, where the following steps are executed: Fetch,
Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back. This project followed the semantics given in the
Y86-64 ISA reference.
